## 🌱 Alpha

This project is still in alpha as we transition all of our [reference platform](https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy-ref) code into fully self hostable worlds.
Most features are already here in this repo but still need to be connected up to work with self hosting in mind.
Note that APIs are highly likely to change during this time.
